### Projects

1. **Advanced Casino Slot Machine System (slot_machine.py).**
A casino-style slot machine simulation featuring real-time animation, multi-tiered symbols, dynamic jackpots, theme management, game state persistence, and statistical analytics. Implemented using object-oriented architecture with tkinter for the graphical user interface.

2. **Professional Translation Application (TRANSLATER.py).** 
A bilingual translation platform supporting Russian-Chinese translations with bidirectional functionality, speech synthesis, clipboard management, bulk text processing, and audio export. Utilizes modular design and asynchronous processing.

3. **Algorithmic Problem Suite (Basic tasks.py, Basic tasks.txt).**  
   A suite of 30 fundamental programming challenges covering mathematical computations, string processing, data structure operations, and algorithmic tasks such as prime detection, palindrome verification, and sorting implementations.

4. **Geometric Computation Library (class_objects.py).**
   A library for calculating properties of geometric shapes, including circles, polygons, triangles, quadrilaterals, and ellipses. Features input validation, inheritance-based hierarchy, and precise computations using the math library.

5. **System Monitoring Application (monitoring_app_system.py).** 
   A diagnostic tool for monitoring hardware components, including CPU, memory, GPU, storage, and system information. Employs multi-threaded data collection and real-time refresh capabilities.

6. **Intelligent Assistant Framework (assistant.py, data.py).** 
   A command-based assistant system with modules for system operations, computational tools, entertainment features, and productivity utilities. Supports plugin extensions and graphical user interface with command history.

7. **And many other projects (see the repository files)**
