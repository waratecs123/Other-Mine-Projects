STRONG PASSWORD CREATION RULES
Core Modern Principles
======================================================
1) Length + True Randomness = Main Source of Strength
    Total length and real entropy matter far more than using dozens of special characters.
2) Minimum Acceptable Level Today
    ~75–80 bits of entropy
    Roughly equals:
        1. 5 truly random words + at least 1–2 extra characters
        2. or 19–21 completely random characters
3) Recommended Comfortable Level (what most security-aware people actually use)
    1. 85–100 bits
    2. Usually achieved with:
    3. 5–6 random words + separators + a few digits/symbols
4) Leetspeak Substitutions Add Almost Nothing
    l→1, o→0, a→@, s→$, e→3 etc.
    Modern cracking tools try all popular substitutions first – they give very little extra strength.
5) Avoid Predictable Appendages
    Worst possible endings that add almost zero strength:
        1. 123, !, !!, .!, #123, year numbers, etc.
        2. If you use digits/symbols – spread them throughout the password.
6) Separators Are Your Best Friend
    Most convenient and effective ones right now: . _ = + ~ * # | !
7) Words Must Be Truly Random and Unrelated
    1. Bad: seasons, rainbow colors, weekdays, famous phrases
    2. Good: completely unrelated, randomly chosen words
8) Word Length Matters
    Medium and long words (6–10 letters) are much more convenient and slightly stronger than many very short 3–4 letter words.
9) Best Places for Digits and Symbols
    Worst: only at the very beginning or very end
    Best practices:
        1. between words
        2. inside words (breaking patterns)
        3. scattered in different positions
10) Most Dangerous Myths Right Now
    1. "More special characters = stronger" → false, length wins
    2. "Must have uppercase + lowercase + digit + symbol" → almost useless requirement today
    3. "18 characters with everything is always strong" → not true if it's a patterned or predictable string

Quick “Is This Password Strong Enough?” Checklist:
======================================================
1) Length ≥ 20 characters or ≥ 5 words
2) No obvious patterns or leetspeak replacements
3) Contains at least 2 different separators/symbols
4) Words are random and not from the same logical group
5) No personal information (name, birthdate, phone, pet, etc.)
6) Password has never been used anywhere before
